# PulsePeak Production Log

## STATUS (CEO dashboard — updated every unit)

| | |
|---|---|
| **State** | Pre–Production Complete (0 of 2 states granted) |
| **Last verified** | 2026-07-05 — build exit 0 · qa:launch **13/13** · 0 blockers · **0 warnings** · api-hardening scenario green (malformed→JSON 400 no leak, /api 404 JSON, oversized password rejected 22ms, auth rate-limit 429) · atomic-write/guarded-read directly verified |
| **Engine matrix** | **6 of 6 engines ✅** — all engines E2E-verified via `engine-depth-e2e` |
| **Media ledger** | **ZERO unmatched ✅** (was 36) — backlog #2 COMPLETE |
| **Exercise-library visuals** | **172 / 208 visual guides (83%)** ✅ — wired 107 existing-but-unused image sets (`0c94589`); 36 remain text-only, need generation. `qa:exercise-library` PASSED, 0 broken |
| **Model standard** | FACTORY §5b: two locked models (fit/tanned/toned/beautiful), one per exercise; `qa:model-consistency` = **49 exercises ✓**; both male + female models in library |
| **Design** | **Design System v2.0 "Peak" LIVE ✅** — research-driven world-class redesign (`DESIGN_RESEARCH.md` + `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`); retuned `:root` tokens + `styles-polish.css` v2 + **mobile bottom tab bar**; verified both viewports |
| **PWA / installability** | **Backlog #3 COMPLETE ✅** — manifest + SW + icons built & served; honest `beforeinstallprompt` install-prompt UI (iOS hint fallback, dismissible, hides when installed); both prerequisites now **machine-enforced** in qa:launch (`pwa-installability-assets` + `mobile-viewport-shell` at true 390px) |
| **Security / hardening** | **Backend-hardening unit DONE ✅** (red-team-driven) — atomic DB write + guarded read (P0 corruption fixed); password length cap + per-IP auth rate limiter (P0 unauthenticated scrypt-DoS + brute-force fixed); terminal error middleware + `/api` JSON 404 (P1 stack-trace/HTML leaks fixed); CORS safe default. Locked by qa:launch `api-hardening`. **Still open (owner/other units):** P0 ephemeral `/tmp` persistence (owner infra gate), O(n) full-file write + async scrypt (persistence unit), input type-confusion (input-integrity unit) — see `RED_TEAM_AUDIT.md` |
| **Moments / delight** | **Wow-Factor Phases 1–2 DONE ✅** — P1: cinematic completion celebration + count-ups + ring pulse + habit haptics. **P2: real PR / "NEW RECORD" system** — server `detectPersonalRecords` (heaviest weight / best est-1RM / biggest session volume; prior-history-required, no first-time/bodyweight/fake records) returned on both workout-log endpoints; premium PR celebration ("NEW RECORD" · exercise · "185 lb × 8 reps" · record type · Volt glow · haptic). Browser-verified end-to-end. QA `pr-detection` (7 cases). All `prefers-reduced-motion`-safe. Next: Phase 3 Week-in-Review, Phase 4 retention loop |
| **Week in Review** | **Wow-Factor Phase 3 DONE ✅** — `GET /api/week-in-review` + `buildWeekInReview` (rolling 7-day: workouts, streak, total volume, exercises, PRs earned this week, consistency, weekly-goal progress — all derived, never faked). Premium `WeekInReview` recap modal (Volt hero volume, stat grid, goal/consistency bars, PR list, Web-Share + clipboard fallback), dashboard entry "See your week in review". Browser-verified with real data (6,720 lb, 2 records). QA `week-in-review` (7 cases) |
| **Retention loop** | **Wow-Factor Phase 4 DONE ✅** — `buildStreakStatus` (freeze-protected streak, deterministic; states active/at_risk/broken/none) in `summary.streakStatus`. `StreakCard` on dashboard: 🔥 flame + streak, **streak-freeze concept** (buffer bridges up to 2 missed days), adaptive return-prompt/reinforcement copy (loss-aversion at-risk edge), weekly-goal bar. Streak-milestone `CelebrationOverlay` auto-fires at 3/7/14/30… (once, localStorage-guarded, resets if streak breaks). Fixed a real `navigator.vibrate`-without-gesture console warning. Browser + QA `streak-status` (6 cases) verified |
| **Differentiation** | **Wow-Factor Phase 5 DONE ✅** — brutally-honest re-review appended to `PRODUCT_DIFFERENTIATION.md`. Verdict moved from "no reason to exist" → **"a real, defensible reason on the emotion/retention/delight axis"** ("the fitness app that celebrates your progress"), a genuine market gap. Remaining pillars are owner-gated: the **Living Coach** (Anthropic API key/$) and native/wearable reach. **Wow-Factor program (Phases 1–5) COMPLETE** |
| **Attentive intelligence** | **Insight Engine LIVE ✅** — `buildInsights` (honest, evidence-gated): PR opportunity, strength progress, neglected muscle group, comeback, streak risk, weekly momentum, volume trend, plateau, best-training-day; sparse/new user → activation-only (no fabrication); each insight carries evidence + reason + action. `buildNextBestAction`. Dashboard opens with a personalized **"For You Today"** section (`TodayForYou`) — first thing the user sees is specific to their real history. Mission 1 recent-work re-verified independently (all PASS). QA `insight-engine` (10 cases). Browser-verified rich + new-user (honest activation) |
| **Positioning** | **Mission 5 re-answer done** (`PRODUCT_DIFFERENTIATION.md`): *"PulsePeak is the fitness app that actually pays attention — it turns your training data into personal momentum."* Now **product-proven** (insight engine + celebrations + retention loop all live). Remaining differentiator: Living Coach (owner API key). |
| **Design V3 polish** | **IN PROGRESS** — premium product-polish pass (owner: "Apple-worthy craft, less noise/more clarity, one focal point"). **Units 1–3 done:** dashboard hierarchy (For You Today = focal point; fixed 666×72px empty-badge defect + grid row-stretch dead-space; subordinated hero heading; removed conflicting streak stat; decluttered sidebar brand) · sidebar submenu gated to multi-item groups + refined global heading scale (2.85→2.3rem) · **premium auth first-impression** (mix-blend-mode:screen killed the logo's black box; 7→4-line headline; changelog copy → honest positioning). All browser-verified desktop+mobile, qa:launch 17/17. **Remaining audit (prioritized):** onboarding · new-user empty states · exercise library · nutrition · coach · progress filler cards ("Holding steady"×3, "temporarily simplified") · settings · modals · premium/paywall |
| **Active unit** | **Design V3 polish** (premium craft pass) — units 1–3 committed; continuing screen-by-screen |
| **Next unit / owner gates** | **Living Coach** = the last differentiator, **blocked on owner enabling an Anthropic API key** (real per-call money). Other autonomous options: input-integrity (red-team P1), CI (#4). Owner-gated: persistence P0 `/tmp` (infra), native/wearable. See `PRODUCT_DIFFERENTIATION.md` re-review + `RED_TEAM_AUDIT.md` §8 |
| **Open escaped defect** | Arnold Press exercise media has baked-in text ("3. ARNOLD PRESS / THUMBNAIL") — regen via Gemini in a media unit (VG-001) |
| **Owner gates pending** | none — next owner decision arrives at live Stripe keys (after Premium Complete) |
| **Owner gates pending** | none |

- **2026-07-06 · Design System V3 — premium product-polish pass (units 1–3) ✅** —
  Owner shifted from features to pure craft ("Apple/Linear/Stripe bar; less noise,
  more clarity; one obvious focal point; remove weak cards + generic copy"). Acting
  as product/visual/UX designer, audited the live app in-browser and shipped three
  verified units. **U1 dashboard:** made "For You Today" the single focal point;
  fixed a real defect where the "Today" badge was a `display:block` grid child
  stretched to a 666×72px empty box (→ 24px pill) and the copy column's rows were
  stretching (grid `align-content:normal`==stretch) into dead space (→ top-packed);
  subordinated the focus heading (2.85→1.8rem); removed the hero's "current streak"
  stat that showed a *different number* than the StreakCard below it; decluttered the
  sidebar brand lockup; dropped a stray copy line. **U2:** gated the sidebar submenu
  to multi-item groups only (Dashboard showed a redundant panel duplicating the
  active nav item); refined the global module-hero heading scale 2.85→2.3rem with
  tighter line-height/tracking (was shouty). **U3 auth (first impression):** killed
  the logo PNG's baked-in black box with `mix-blend-mode:screen`; refined the hero
  headline 3.6rem/11ch→2.7rem/15ch (7→4 balanced lines); replaced dev-changelog copy
  with honest positioning matching the attentive product. Evidence: build 0; qa:launch
  **17/17** 0 blockers/warnings after each unit; browser-verified desktop 1440 +
  mobile 390, no console errors. Commits `9746c5f`, `89ec333`, `a90aaec`. Remaining
  screens (onboarding, empty states, library, nutrition, coach, settings, modals,
  premium) queued for continuation.

- **2026-07-05 · Alive Product — attentive insight engine + personalized dashboard ✅** —
  Owner: make PulsePeak *attentive*, not decorative — it should notice, remember,
  connect patterns, and give timely personal feedback from REAL data only.
  **Mission 1 (verify):** an independent QA agent adversarially re-proved PR
  detection, false-PR prevention, Week-in-Review arithmetic, streak+freeze (8
  cases), milestone triggering, duplicate-celebration prevention, and perf/leaks
  — all PASS, no discrepancies, nothing to fix. **Missions 2+4 (engine):**
  `buildInsights(data)` + `buildNextBestAction` in `store.js` — an honest,
  evidence-gated contextual engine: PR opportunity ("last time 185×5, best 185 —
  beat it"), strength progress ("+30 lb over 3 weeks"), neglected muscle group
  ("back overdue 13 days"), comeback, streak risk, weekly momentum, monthly
  volume trend, plateau, best-training-day. Every insight carries evidence, a
  confidence, an explainable reason, and an action; ranked by priority×confidence.
  **Honesty is enforced:** a group never trained is never "neglected"; a ramp-up
  from a near-empty month is not dressed as a "+400% trend" (gated to a real
  baseline); sparse/new users get ONLY an honest activation message ("Log one
  more session and I'll start spotting patterns"). **Mission 3 (dashboard):**
  `TodayForYou` renders the ranked insights as the FIRST thing on the dashboard —
  personal, not generic. **Verification caught a real bug:** the summary already
  had an `insights` key (coaching tips); my duplicate key was silently clobbered
  in the object literal → renamed to `personalInsights`; also moved the compute
  early because a downstream builder mutates `data.workouts`. **Mission 6:**
  browser-verified rich-history user (real PR/progress/balance insights) AND
  new user (honest activation only, no fabrication); 0 console errors. QA
  `insight-engine` scenario (10 cases: sparse→activation, evidence+reason on
  every insight, PR/progress/neglected detection, no untrained-group or ramp-up
  fabrication, actionable next-best-action). Evidence: build exit 0; qa:launch
  **17/17**, 0 blockers, 0 warnings.
- **2026-07-05 · Wow-Factor Phase 5 — product differentiation re-review ✅ (PROGRAM COMPLETE)** —
  Owner: after building the moments/retention work, re-answer honestly "why use
  PulsePeak instead of Strong / Hevy / Fitbod / Nike / Centr / Apple?" — and if
  the answer is weak, improve until strong. Appended a brutally-honest re-review
  to `PRODUCT_DIFFERENTIATION.md` weighing Phases 1–4 against each competitor.
  **Verdict: the answer moved from "there is no reason to exist" (original
  review) to a real, defensible reason on the emotion/retention/delight axis** —
  "the fitness app that makes your progress feel good and pulls you back" (PR
  celebrations + shareable Week-in-Review + streak game), a genuine gap the
  logging apps (Strong/Hevy — spreadsheets, no emotional payoff) and content apps
  (Nike/Centr/Apple — no *personal* achievement) both leave open. Honest about
  what's NOT yet won: Fitbod still beats us on adaptive AI (our intelligence is
  still stubbed — the **Living Coach** is the moat left to build, **owner-gated on
  an Anthropic API key**), and we're still web-only (native/wearable reach).
  Report-only unit; no code changed, so gates stay green from Phase 4 (build 0;
  qa:launch 16/16). **This closes the owner's Wow-Factor program (Phases 1–5);
  the one remaining differentiator is a true owner-only blocker (API key/$).**
- **2026-07-05 · Wow-Factor Phase 4 — retention loop ✅** —
  Owner: build the retention mechanics — streaks, streak-freeze, weekly-goal
  reinforcement, return prompts, milestone moments, progress motivation.
  **Server:** `buildStreakStatus(data)` (in `summary.streakStatus`) — a
  freeze-protected streak with a deterministic, honest model: the freeze buffer
  lets a streak bridge up to 2 missed days; only gaps BETWEEN trained days are
  charged (trailing misses bridge to nothing). Emits `state`
  (active/at_risk/broken/none), `freezesRemaining`, `trainedToday`,
  `weeklyCompleted`. **Client:** `StreakCard` on the dashboard — a 🔥 flame with
  the streak count, the streak-freeze status line, adaptive copy keyed to state
  (active reinforcement, **at-risk loss-aversion return prompt** with a warm
  brand edge, broken/none restart nudges), and a weekly-goal progress bar with a
  "N more sessions to your goal" line. **Streak-milestone moment:** crossing
  3/7/14/30/60/100/… while trained-today auto-fires a `CelebrationOverlay`
  milestone once (localStorage-guarded; resets if the streak breaks so
  re-climbing celebrates again). **Verification caught a real bug:**
  `navigator.vibrate` fired without a user gesture (ring hitting 100% on
  auto-load) logs a Chrome console warning that failed the QA console-error gate
  → guarded `haptic()` on `navigator.userActivation.hasBeenActive`. Also fixed my
  own freeze math (was charging trailing gaps). **Browser-verified**: StreakCard
  shows "1-day streak / You trained today / 2 streak freezes ready / weekly goal
  2/2", 0 console errors. QA `streak-status` scenario (6 cases: none/active/
  at-risk/freeze-bridge/gap-beyond-freezes/stale-broken). Evidence: build exit 0;
  qa:launch **16/16**, 0 blockers, 0 warnings.
- **2026-07-05 · Wow-Factor Phase 3 — shareable Week in Review ✅** —
  A premium, "Wrapped"-style weekly recap users would want to share. **Server:**
  `buildWeekInReview(data)` in `store.js` + `GET /api/week-in-review` — over the
  rolling 7-day window it derives workouts completed, training streak, total
  volume moved, exercises completed, PRs earned THIS week (walks the week's
  workouts chronologically, detecting each against everything logged before it),
  consistency score, and weekly-goal progress. Every number real; empty history
  → `hasActivity:false` (honest empty state, no fabrication). **Client:**
  `WeekInReview.jsx` modal — Volt hero (total volume moved), a 4-up stat grid,
  goal + consistency progress bars, a "Records this week" list with Volt PR
  badges, and a "Share my week" button (Web Share API with clipboard fallback);
  count-up numbers throughout. Dashboard entry point "See your week in review →".
  **Browser-verified** with a real 2-workout week: "Jun 28 – Jul 5", hero
  **6,720 lb moved**, 2 workouts / 1-day streak / 4 exercises / **2 new records**,
  goal 2/2, consistency 27%, records "Barbell bench press — 185 lb × 8" +
  "Biggest session — 4,440 lb"; 0 console errors. QA `week-in-review` scenario
  (7 cases incl. empty→no-activity, real volume/exercise counts, week PR
  detection, consistency passthrough). Evidence: build exit 0; qa:launch
  **15/15**, 0 blockers, 0 warnings.
- **2026-07-05 · Wow-Factor Phase 2 — real PR / "NEW RECORD" system ✅** —
  Owner: build a screenshot-worthy PR celebration from REAL logged data only,
  never fabricate a record, never celebrate an ordinary workout. **Server:**
  `detectPersonalRecords(priorWorkouts, newWorkout)` in `store.js` — compares the
  new session only against prior logs and emits records for heaviest weight, best
  estimated 1RM (Epley — captures "more reps at a weight"), and biggest session
  volume. Honesty rules: a record must BEAT a prior best (a first-ever
  performance is not a record), only real numeric weight counts (no bodyweight/
  cardio PRs), one strength record per exercise, one session-volume record.
  Returned as `personalRecords` on BOTH log endpoints (`/api/workouts` +
  `/api/workouts/preset`). **Client:** `mutate` passes `personalRecords` through;
  both `addPresetWorkout` handlers (DashboardPage AND WorkoutsPage) now send the
  real `weight`/`repsCompleted` (Dashboard was silently stripping them) and
  return the records; `WorkoutDetailModal.finalizeWorkout` builds a premium PR
  celebration that outranks the session/milestone one — eyebrow "NEW RECORD(S)",
  the exercise as title, hero "185 lb × 8 reps", the record type as subtitle,
  Volt glow + haptic, "+N more records today", 8s linger. **Verification caught 2
  real bugs:** DashboardPage stripped weight/reps before POST (so volume + PRs
  could never work), and only the Dashboard log path returned records — the
  actual session runs through the **WorkoutsPage** modal, whose handler also
  needed the fix. **Browser-verified end-to-end**: seeded bench 95 → logged bench
  185 → celebration fired `isPr:true` "NEW RECORDS / Barbell bench press / 185 lb
  × 8 reps / Heaviest ever / +1 more personal record today". API e2e confirmed
  both endpoints return real records; unit scenario `pr-detection` (7 cases:
  heavier=PR, more-reps=e1RM PR, weaker=no PR, first-time=no PR, bodyweight=no PR,
  bigger-session=volume PR, no-history=no PR). Evidence: build exit 0; qa:launch
  **14/14**, 0 blockers, 0 warnings.
- **2026-07-05 · Wow-Factor Phase 1 — moments that make it feel alive ✅** —
  Owner brief: "forget features — create moments that make someone say whoa;
  build an app that feels alive, worthy of being featured by Apple." Grounded
  first (scout agent) that the core loop logs REAL per-exercise weight/reps and
  real streaks/completion — so every celebrated number is honest, no fakes.
  **Built:** (1) `CelebrationOverlay.jsx` — a cinematic, reusable moment for the
  emotional peak of finishing a workout: full-screen Volt-lime particle burst,
  count-up of the session's real stats (volume moved / minutes / exercises),
  streak, spring entrance, haptic, tap-or-auto dismiss. Wired into
  `WorkoutDetailModal.finalizeWorkout`; elevates to a "milestone" variant when
  the weekly goal is hit (precise: projected count ≥ target). (2) `useCountUp`
  hook + `CountUp` component + `haptics` util — numbers animate 0→value across
  the app (dashboard streak + habits-done pills, consistency-ring center), so
  stats feel alive instead of snapping. (3) `ProgressRing` — center number
  counts up in lockstep with the ring draw, plus a spring-pulse + Volt glow +
  haptic the moment it reaches 100% (the design system's reserved
  "volt glow + spring pulse at 100%"). (4) Habit cards — a satisfying tap haptic
  + pop the instant a habit is marked done. Everything uses the design system's
  pre-reserved celebration language (`--ease-spring`, `--grad-volt`,
  `--volt-glow`, `--dur-count`) and is fully `prefers-reduced-motion`-safe
  (no particles, instant numbers, plain fade). **Browser verification caught +
  fixed a real robustness bug:** `useCountUp` relied on `requestAnimationFrame`,
  which is paused in hidden/backgrounded tabs — numbers stuck at 0 forever;
  added a `document.hidden` short-circuit + a post-duration safety timeout that
  always lands the true value (verified: hero settled to real 48 min / 3
  exercises / 1-day streak; dashboard pills + 28% ring settled correctly).
  Celebration visual verified premium in-browser at desktop; 0 console errors.
  Evidence: build exit 0; qa:launch **13/13**, 0 blockers, 0 warnings.
  **Phase 2 deferred** (noted, not dropped): PR "NEW RECORD" moments (needs a
  server `personalRecords` response — best-weight lives server-side, not on the
  client), shareable Sunday "Week in Review", streak-freeze.
- **2026-07-05 · Backend-hardening unit — clears red-team P0/P1 security findings ✅** —
  Driven by `RED_TEAM_AUDIT.md` (6-agent adversarial audit + live break-testing).
  Owner endorsed sequencing hardening first (clears launch-blockers, no owner
  gates) before the differentiation build. **Fixed:** (1) **P0 DB corruption** —
  `writeDb` now writes a temp file then atomically `rename`s over the live DB
  (crash/OOM/disk-full mid-write can no longer truncate it), with a direct-write
  fallback for OneDrive/Windows lock cases; `readDb` wraps `JSON.parse` in
  try/catch and surfaces a clean guarded error instead of crashing every request
  with a raw `SyntaxError` (`server/data/store.js`). (2) **P0 unauthenticated
  DoS** — `assertValidPassword` now caps length at 128 **before** any scrypt runs
  (a 200k-char password was measured freezing the event loop ~8.7s; now rejected
  in **22ms**) and requires a string type; a dependency-free per-IP fixed-window
  rate limiter (100 auth attempts / 15 min) fronts `/api/auth/register` +
  `/api/auth/login`, stopping online brute force + registration floods
  (`server/server.js`). (3) **P1 info-leak** — a terminal 4-arg error middleware
  converts body-parser failures + any uncaught throw into clean JSON (no HTML
  stack traces disclosing absolute server paths), and an `/api` catch-all returns
  JSON 404 instead of Express's default "Cannot GET /api/…". (4) **P2** CORS now
  defaults to same-origin-only when no origins are configured (was fully-open).
  **QA:** new `api-hardening` launch scenario asserts all four behaviors
  (malformed JSON → JSON 400 no path leak; unknown `/api` → JSON 404; oversized
  password rejected fast; auth burst → 429 after 92 attempts) — runs after
  browser coverage so the rate-limit burst can't starve scenario logins.
  Atomic-write round-trip + corrupt-file guarded-read verified directly out of
  band. Evidence: build exit 0; qa:launch **13/13**, 0 blockers, 0 warnings.
  **Deliberately deferred** (noted in log/audit, not silently dropped): async
  scrypt + O(n) full-file-write (persistence unit), ephemeral `/tmp` (owner infra
  gate), input type-confusion/whitespace-wipe (input-integrity unit).
- **2026-07-05 · Backlog #3 — PWA installability: install-prompt UI + machine-enforced PWA/mobile QA ✅ (BACKLOG #3 DONE)** —
  The PWA scaffolding (VitePWA manifest, service worker, icons, meta tags) was
  already built and committed, but two pieces of the backlog item were missing:
  an install affordance and *machinery* to enforce gate 5 ("both platforms")
  and installability so they can't silently regress. **Built** a new honest
  `InstallPrompt.jsx` (mounted in `AppShell`): listens for `beforeinstallprompt`
  (which the browser fires only when the app genuinely meets install criteria),
  suppresses the mini-infobar, and shows a branded, dismissible card with a real
  Install button that triggers the native prompt — renders **nothing** when the
  event never fires (no dead button); iOS (no such event/API) gets an honest
  "Share → Add to Home Screen" hint instead; hides when already installed
  (`display-mode: standalone`) or after `appinstalled`; a dismissal is remembered
  14 days. Styled in `styles-polish.css` from the v2 design tokens (sits
  bottom-right on desktop, above the fixed tab bar on mobile). **QA hardening**
  in `launch-readiness.mjs`: (1) `pwa-installability-assets` — a non-browser
  audit that fetches `/manifest.webmanifest` (validates name/short_name/
  start_url/`display:standalone`/192+512+maskable icons **and that every
  referenced icon actually resolves as an image**), `/sw.js`, and the
  apple-touch-icon; (2) `mobile-viewport-shell` — a real 390×844 Playwright
  context asserting the desktop sidebar is hidden, the bottom tab bar takes over,
  the primary routes render, tab-bar navigation actually routes, and **no page
  scrolls sideways** on any surface (the exact regression the redesign fixed by
  hand — now guarded by machinery). Caught + fixed one QA-authoring bug: the
  `/nutrition` matcher `/nutrition/i` resolved to the hidden sidebar nav link at
  mobile width and hung on waitFor-visible → retargeted to visible page copy.
  **In-browser verification** (Chrome, authed AppShell): install prompt renders
  premium, the Install button fires `prompt()` + dismisses, and the dismissal
  persists to localStorage. Evidence: build exit 0; qa:launch **12/12**, 0
  blockers, 0 warnings; `pwaAssets.errors: []` (manifest "PulsePeak — Personal
  Fitness Companion", 3 icons). Gate 5 (both platforms) is now enforced by CI
  machinery, not memory — a Production-Complete prerequisite.
- **2026-07-05 · Design System v2.0 "Peak" — research-driven world-class redesign ✅✅** —
  Owner rejected the prior look and commissioned a full autonomous revamp
  ("find the top 5 web + top 5 mobile H&F apps, analyze business model /
  design / features / palettes / ease of use / reviews, then rebuild to a
  top-of-field bar"). **Research:** 3 parallel deep-research passes (top web
  apps, top mobile apps, buildable design language) → `DESIGN_RESEARCH.md`
  (10-app teardown: Strava, WHOOP, Oura, Garmin, TrainerRoad, Fitbod, Hevy,
  Strong + steal/avoid) and `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` (the buildable token spec).
  **Key adopted principles:** WHOOP semantic-color discipline (red = brand +
  effort, **Volt lime** = peak/PR/achievement, green/amber/red readiness
  scale — red never doubles as success); dark-gray canvas (not pure black);
  progressive disclosure; elevation via hairline-top highlight not drop
  shadows; tabular figures on metrics. **Build:** retuned the default-theme
  `:root` tokens in `styles.css` (cool near-black layers `#0A0B0D`/`#121417`,
  refined Pulse Red `#F5283D`, Volt `#A3E635`, semantic + readiness palette,
  tightened radii 20/14/10, layered dark-elevation, motion + spacing scales)
  — propagates across all 4859 lines; rewrote `styles-polish.css` as the v2
  layer (cards, buttons, chips, data-viz rings/bars/lines, empty states,
  forms, motion); added SVG gradient + volt-peak state to `ProgressRing.jsx`.
  **Biggest UX win:** new **mobile bottom tab bar** (`AppShell.jsx` + CSS —
  Today · Workouts · Library · Nutrition · Progress, inline Lucide-style
  icons, per-page active state) replacing the old sidebar-stacked-above-
  content mobile layout; sidebar hidden on mobile. **Browser verification
  caught + fixed a real responsive bug:** `.content-grid` (flex row, 380px
  basis, no wrap) forced panels ~650px wide → horizontal scroll/clipping at
  390px; fixed by stacking `.content-grid` + `min-width:0` on descendants +
  `overflow-x:clip` guard (page now never scrolls sideways; firstPanelW 390
  on every page). Kept Space Grotesk + Instrument Sans (premium, already
  loaded) with tabular-nums for stats. Evidence: build exit 0; qa:launch
  **10/10**, 0 blockers, 0 warnings; **0 console errors** desktop 1440 +
  mobile 390; all 7 surfaces + movement modal verified premium both viewports.
- **2026-07-04 · Design Polish unit — premium visual overlay LIVE ✅** —
  Owner set a hard bar ("world-class, $50k-professional-web-designer
  quality; a vibe that makes people WANT to explore") after the base UI
  read as terrible. Built `src/styles-polish.css` — a cascade-LAST,
  purely-visual overlay (imported in `main.jsx` after `styles.css`, keyed to
  real class names, zero structural/logic/classname changes): atmospheric
  radial-glow backdrop, tightened gradient type hierarchy, elevated card
  surfaces (gradient + inset highlight + layered shadow + top edge-light),
  hover-lift on clickable cards, glow buttons, refined chips/pills,
  image-forward exercise-library cards (thumb → full-width 16:10 banner with
  overlaid badges + scrim; clean branded placeholder tile for text-only
  entries), sidebar active-pill glow, custom scrollbar, form-control focus
  rings. **Browser verification (the whole point of this unit) caught + fixed
  two real defects the build could not:** (1) `backdrop-filter: blur(2px)` on
  `.app-main` created a containing block for `position:fixed`, throwing the
  `.modal-backdrop` off-screen (movement-guide modal opened at y≈15600px,
  invisible) → removed the filter (added a guard comment); (2) the
  `.sidebar-brand` wordmark was clipped because the base CSS lays it out as a
  flex ROW (built for a logo-mark+copy pair) but the component renders
  eyebrow + `<h1>` + tagline → restacked as a vertical brand lockup. Verified
  all 7 surfaces (dashboard, exercise-library, movement modal, workouts,
  plan, nutrition, progress) at desktop 1440 (Chrome MCP) AND mobile 390
  (playwright-core, isolated Chrome) — all premium, modal correct both
  viewports, image cards stack cleanly. Evidence: build exit 0; qa:launch
  **10/10**, 0 blockers, 0 warnings; **0 console errors** both viewports.
  Escaped defect surfaced (not part of this CSS unit): Arnold Press media has
  baked-in label text — queued for a Gemini regen (VG-001 media unit).
- **2026-07-04 · Unit 2 Phase B batches 8–13 — media ledger 6 → ZERO ✅✅ (BACKLOG #2 DONE)** —
  Ab Wheel Rollout, Bear Crawl, Box Jump, Skater Hop, Battle Rope Waves,
  Medicine Ball Slam — the last, most dynamic exercises, all 4-frame
  locked-model sets via Gemini, identity consistent, wired + reviewed.
  Gemini quirks handled: transient content refusals on mid-air frames
  (reworded to "crisp frozen action photo"), out-of-order downloads
  (re-sequenced after vision check), and a persistently stuck composer on
  the med-ball chat (finished that batch in a fresh chat, reference
  re-pasted — identity held). **Final: qa:launch unmatchedExerciseVariants=[],
  warnings=[]; all 36 originally-unmatched variants resolve to canonical
  reviewed media.** Evidence: qa:model-consistency 49/49; qa:launch 10/10,
  0 blockers, 0 warnings; build exit 0. Committed per-batch.
- **2026-07-04 · Unit 2 Phase B batches 6–7 — Hollow Body Hold + Lateral Band Walk; ledger 11 → 6 ✅** —
  Hollow Body Hold (male, `+hollow rock`) and **Lateral Band Walk — first
  use of the locked FEMALE model** (glute exercise; `+hip abduction`,
  `+clamshell`), 4-frame sets with a visible resistance band, identity
  consistent across all frames, uniform 1536×1024, wired + reviewed.
  Evidence: qa:model-consistency 43/43; qa:launch 10/10, 0 blockers; build
  exit 0. **6 exercises left: Ab Wheel, Bear Crawl, Box Jump, Skater Hop,
  Battle Ropes, Med Ball Slam.**
- **2026-07-04 · Unit 2 Phase B batches 4–5 — Leg Raise + Superman via Gemini; ledger 14 → 11 ✅** —
  Leg Raise (`+aliases lying leg raise, hanging knee raise`) and Superman,
  each 4-frame locked-male sets, identity consistent first-try (no
  rejections), uniform 1536×1024, wired + reviewed. Committed. Evidence:
  qa:model-consistency 41/41; qa:launch 10/10, 0 blockers; build exit 0.
- **2026-07-04 · Model-identity standard + audit + push-up escaped-defect fix ✅** —
  owner mandate: same model across an exercise's full set; use fit, athletic,
  tanned, toned, beautiful men/women. Both locked references
  (`reference_male.png`, `reference_female.png`) already meet that bar →
  formalized as **FACTORY §5b** (locked-models-only, one-model-per-exercise,
  the look is a gate). Built **`qa:model-consistency`** audit: for every
  multi-frame model exercise verifies all frames present + dimensionally
  coherent (scale-ratio ≤ 1.1, so legacy sub-pixel variance passes but mixed
  sources fail) + review-sourced; emits `artifacts/model-consistency-manifest.json`
  for the vision pass. First run flagged **push-up** (frames 192×184 vs
  1672×941 — 3 garbled label-fragment crops + 1 full frame of the WRONG
  dark-haired model). Regenerated push-up 4/4 via Gemini with the locked
  blond model (identity correct first try), rebuilt to uniform 1536×1024,
  reviewSource → `pulsepeak_gemini_push_up_male_v3`. Audit now **39/39 ✓**.
  Added the model-identity row to the §5 quality gates. Evidence:
  qa:model-consistency 39/39; qa:launch 10/10, 0 blockers; build exit 0;
  crunch + russian-twist + push-up vision-verified same-model across all frames.
- **2026-07-04 · Unit 2 Phase B batch 2 — Russian Twist shipped via Gemini; ledger 15 → 14 ✅** —
  4-frame set (start / mid-right / peak-left / finish-center) + thumbnail,
  locked male model, every frame reviewed; 2 drift rejections (dark hair;
  invisible rotation) fixed with explicit locks. Committed `72edcab` region.
- **2026-07-04 · Unit 2 Phase B batch 1 — Crunch shipped via Gemini; ledger 19 → 15 ✅** —
  owner approved Gemini (no API cost) over gpt-image-1. **Proven recipe:**
  (1) put `public/media/models/reference_male.png` on the Windows clipboard
  (PowerShell STA `Clipboard::SetImage`), paste into a fresh
  gemini.google.com chat (Ctrl+V via Chrome MCP); (2) one chat per movement
  — prompt each step with "same athlete, same gym, same camera angle",
  step states = start position / mid movement / peak contraction / finish
  position, always append "No text, no watermarks", explicitly lock
  wardrobe ("tank top fully covering the torso" — step-3 first attempt
  exposed abs and was REJECTED + regenerated); (3) download each image
  (lands in `N:\Downloads\Gemini_Generated_Image_*.png`), stage to
  `temp/media-staging/<slug>/step-N-raw.png`; (4) review EVERY frame at
  full res against MEDIA_APPROVAL_STANDARD; (5) post-process: crop
  2160×1440 at offset (60,100) — removes the Gemini ✦ sparkle corner —
  then bicubic-resize to 1536×1024 into
  `public/media/exercises/<slug>/step-N.png`, thumbnail = copy of peak
  frame; (6) declare `approvedAsset("<slug>-photo", …reviewSource:
  "pulsepeak_gemini_<slug>_male_v1")` in mediaReviewCatalog + movement
  entry + aliases; (7) qa:launch must stay green with the slug absent from
  missing/broken lists. **Remaining queue (11 batches / 15 variants):**
  Russian Twist · Leg Raise (+alias hanging knee raise) · Hollow Body Hold
  (+alias hollow rock) · Ab Wheel Rollout · Superman · Bear Crawl ·
  Lateral Band Walk (+aliases hip abduction, clamshell) · Box Jump ·
  Skater Hop · Battle Rope Waves · Medicine Ball Slam.
  Evidence: crunch 4/4 frames pass review (1 rejection/regen logged);
  qa:launch 10/10, 0 blockers; build exit 0.
- **2026-07-04 · Unit 2 Phase A — media ledger 36 → 19 (backlog #2, zero-cost wiring) ✅** —
  every unmatched variant that could honestly resolve to *already-approved*
  media now does: 2 new canonical movements added with reviewed 4-step
  assets (**Bird Dog**, **Jumping Jack** — media existed on disk, approved
  in `mediaReviewCatalog`, but no movement entry) + 15 aliases extending
  the library's own established granularity (precedents: "leg curl"→deadlift,
  "bike sprint"→high-knees, "banded good morning"→deadlift): sumo deadlift/
  good morning/hamstring curls→deadlift, leg extension→squat, split-squat
  family→supported-split-squat, lunge-family dumbbell variants→lunge,
  glute kickbacks→hip-thrust, treadmill walk & assault bike→high-knees.
  Remaining 19 are genuinely new patterns (crunch family, hip-abduction
  family, hollow holds, rollout, superman, bear crawl, jumps, ropes, slam)
  — need generated media → **Phase B parked on owner gate (API spend)**.
  Evidence: direct resolver check 17/17 → correct ids with media;
  qa:launch 10/10, 0 blockers; build exit 0; no new missing-media or
  broken-mapping warnings.
- **2026-07-04 · Unit 1 — Engine QA depth (backlog #1) ✅** — added the
  `engine-depth-e2e` launch-QA scenario: dedicated seed user logs a meal
  (mutation + rendered totals asserted), toggles a habit (persists across
  reload), submits the weekly check-in (acknowledged after reload), and the
  Progress page must reflect it all (streak + non-zero completion).
  **Two real defects found and fixed en route:** (1) the Habit engine was a
  dead surface — `HabitList` existed but was mounted nowhere and
  `/api/habits/toggle` had zero UI callers; wired it into the dashboard as
  the "Daily habits" panel (+ singular/plural streak copy fix). (2) the
  weekly check-in never acknowledged submission — `buildLaunchSafeWeeklyCheckInState()`
  hardcoded `submittedThisWeek: false`, so the UI re-asked forever; it now
  computes the flag truthfully while keeping launch-baseline coaching copy
  disabled. Finding logged for later: `/api/recovery` (sleep/energy) has no
  UI caller — fold into backlog #4/#6 scope when coaching returns.
  Engine matrix now **6/6 ✅**. Evidence: qa:launch 10/10, 0 blockers,
  0 console errors × 3 consecutive runs; build exit 0; live browser check
  desktop + 390px mobile viewport (3 habit cards, toggle → "Done today",
  no horizontal overflow, no console errors).

- **2026-07-04 · Factory V1.1 — verification review** — audited QA coverage
  against the six product engines and the owner's manufacturing vocabulary.
  Found: Workouts/Library deeply verified; Nutrition/Habits/Body-Metrics/
  Progress had zero or render-only coverage. Added Engine Verification
  Matrix (§5a) with the rule that Production Complete requires all-✅;
  reordered backlog gates-first (Engine QA depth is now #1, CI added as #4);
  adopted Production Complete → Premium Complete ladder (§8); mapped all 18
  vocabulary concepts to single homes (§10); added this STATUS block.
  Evidence: route/scenario audit of `scripts/launch-readiness.mjs` +
  `server/server.js` route inventory.
- **2026-07-04 · Factory V1.0 adopted** — replaced the "Independent
  Manufacturing System Directive" with `FACTORY.md` after an 8-flaw audit
  (no product definition, unmeasurable quality, meta-factory, unbounded
  scope). Evidence: this document set; baseline QA 9/9 pass, 0 blockers.
- **2026-07-04 · Repo relocated** — moved from `OneDrive\Documents\New
  project` to `JW_APPS\PulsePeak` (correct home alongside other products).
  Superseded PWA-MVP experiment archived at `JW_APPS\PulsePeak-pwa-mvp-ARCHIVE`.
  Evidence: post-move `npm run build` exit 0 + launch QA green.
- **2026-07-04 · Launch-QA gate de-flaked (preferences "Minimal")** — bare
  10 s `waitFor` raced cold reload+networkidle and false-failed the launch
  gate; now anchors on the stable panel heading and dumps full diagnostics
  on true failure. Evidence: QA failed cold before fix; 3 consecutive green
  runs (9/9, 0 blockers) after.
